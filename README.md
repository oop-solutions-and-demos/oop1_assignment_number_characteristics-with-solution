# Object Oriented Programming with Java - Assignment Base Repository

This is an assignment for the course Object Oriented Programming with Java for students of VIVES University in Bruges.

The goal of this assignment is to learn to work with decision making structures and make use of mathematical operators.

## Assignment

Create a new application that requests two integral numbers from the user. Your job is to output some characteristics about both numbers. Make sure that all the following items are outputted:

* The sum of the two numbers
* The difference of the two numbers
* The biggest of the two numbers
* If the number is even or uneven (for each number)
* If the number is negative, zero or positive (for each number)
* The square of each number

Example output:

```text
Welcome to my number properties app. Input two numbers and I will tell you some important
characteristics about them. You can even input negative numbers.

Please input the first number: 15
Please input the second number: -30

    - first + second = 15
    - first - second = 45
    - The biggest number is the first (15)
    - The first number is:
        - uneven
        - positive
        - square is 225
    - The second number is:
        - even
        - negative
        - square is 900

Thank you for using this application made by Nico.
